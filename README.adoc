= sgscad

This is a library of OpenSCAD modules, mainly focussed on creating practical,
3d-printable objects.

this was a private repo, so the docs are a bit sketchy. I'll continue to update them.
The docs that exist are in this directory:

link:subdir/[Open subdir]

Also, there is documentation in the indevidual files. The files included are:

- archimedes.scad Creates an archimedes screw, either by itself, or built into a pipe;
- bottlecap.scad  28mm bottlecap thread.
- chains.scad Make chain links or complete chains
- desk_drawer.scad  A drawer frame with multiple drawers.
- joint.scad  Create dovetail or ball and socket joints.
- panels.scad Create sloped panels, including one that has holes to mount coins for
  display.
